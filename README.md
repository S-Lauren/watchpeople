## Watch People ##

WatchPeople is an application to keep track of prisoners. 
The project was made with fake data and random user API for portrait.
Coded in React.js and Material UI for CSS. 

# As an officer I can : 

- Search an inmate by Lastname or firstname.
- Filter inmate's list by their favorite fruit (banana, apple...)

- Read the details of an inmate : 
  - A map with all markers of places where the inmate goes.
  - General informations (eye color, age, etc..)
  - See the last purchases the inmate did and filter it by an amount's scale.
  - See the last messages sent by the inmate and filter it by a start date.
  - Filter all messages sent by Facebook.  


* Deployment here : https://watchpeople.netlify.app/


Nice to have :

- Underline keyword "nulla" in red for insults in messages filtered.
- Have a multi selection on buttons
- Have all the filter source for message.
